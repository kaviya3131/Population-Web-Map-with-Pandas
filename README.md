# Volcano-and-Population-Web-Map-with-Pandas


A web map created by using folium and pandas.

The map includes a layer control panel from which you can toggle the features--such as population and volcanoes-- on and off.


The colors of countries on the map represent their population, and the colors of the circle markers represent the elevations of the volcanoes.
